# Git, Github and VSCode

In this Learning Pod, we will teach you how to run Git from the terminal, but it would almost be a crime not to give you alternatives using VSCode. Even though working in the terminal is more than enough, VSCode has Git and Github integrations that will make your life easier.

Not only does it come with some basic functionalities by default, but there are several VSCode extensions that will take your Git capabilities to another level.
