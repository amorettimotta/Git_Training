# What is a branch? 

Imagine you're writing a piece of code for some project. Everything works and that is great! Now you want to explore an alternative or want to add some feature... and now nothing works! ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€

## Introduce branching! 

Branches allows you to work on new ideas without affecting the main piece of code. Once you're happy with the new addition/s, you can then add them back into the main body.

Hence, a branch in Git is like a separate path, copied from the original, where you can make changes without affecting the main project. And once you are done experimenting you can decide to include the changes, or discard everything! Itâ€™s a way to work on different tasks separately and keep things organized.

## Why Use Branches?

Normally, each branch has an specific objective: work on a new feature, fix a bug, refactor some code, etc. These branches allow you to experiment and test out ideas safely.
