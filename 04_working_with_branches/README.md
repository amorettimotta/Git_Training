# Working with Branches

Until now, the tracking capabilities of Git are clear, but we told you it is a tool for collaborating, so how can we achieve this?

You probably already heard the term _branch_ in any of the videos. These are the minimum units of collaborative work that you will use.  

Therefore, in this section, we will teach you:
1. [Merging Branches](01_merging_branches.md)
2. [Resolving Merge Conflicts](02_merge_conflicts.md)
3. [Pushing and Pulling from Remote](03_push_and_pull.md)
4. [Best practices](04_keeping_linear_history.md): Keeping a Linear Commit History
