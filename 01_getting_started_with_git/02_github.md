# If that is Git, then what is GitHub?

Think of GitHub as a meeting point for coders. It's a platform that uses Git at its core, but it offers a space to store and share those code 'snapshots' we talked about. **This repo is on Github, of course!**

One of its standout features? Collaboration tools. On GitHub, you can suggest changes, review code, and track issues. This makes working together smoother and more transparent. But it also allows for managing user permissions.

But there's more. Github has automation tools, and with them you can set up workflows for Continuous Integration (CI) —_a. k. a._ testing your code automatically— and Continuous Deployment (CD)—automatically making your code available once it is ready. No more manual checks or repetitive tasks!

And to add an extra layer of security to your projects, GitHub allows for encrypted variables that you can use in your workflows, ensuring sensitive information like API keys stay hidden and safe.

All in all, GitHub is more than just a storage space; it's a comprehensive toolkit for modern developers. 

In case you are looking for something more inspirational, let Github tell you what Github is.
