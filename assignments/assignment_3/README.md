# Assignment 3

1. In your repository, create a new branch called `accident_analysis` and add an accident analysis system in a file named `accident_analysis.py`, which predicts the possibility of an accident based on a policyholder's details. 
2. Invite a colleague to your repository and manage the repo's permissions to make it such that you can only merge a pull request if a colleague approves the changes. 
3. Open a pull request from the `accident_analysis` branch into the `staging` branch and request a colleague to review the changes.
4. You should be requested by a colleague to review their pull request. Leave constructive code review comments on their pull request. Recall the [code reviews section](https://github.com/DareData/lp-foundations/blob/main/05_assessing_code_quality/2_code_reviews.md).
5. Once the pull request is accepted, merge it into the `staging`.
