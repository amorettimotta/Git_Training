# What is Git?

So, you might have heard the term Git thrown around or else you are wondering why are you learning this on the first place, so what is it? 🤔 

Git is what we call a _version control system_. Huh? Yes, fancy words... Think of it like a time machine 🕰️ for your code. It allows you to snap 'pictures' (or save states) of your code at various stages of your project. And here's the kicker – _you can hop back and forth between these snapshots anytime you want!_. Spilled coffee on your keyboard and accidentally deleted half your code? No worries! Git's got your back. 🙌

But wait, there's more! It can spot the differences between these snapshots. So imagine a team of coders, each working from the same starting point, tweaking different parts of the code. Git helps weave these different changes together, ensuring they fit perfectly. Best of all? You control this process the entire time, deciding what to keep, what to delete or even how to combine these changes.

And if you're wondering why Git and not any other similar system, the reasons are: it's fast, it's secure, it's flexible, and... free! 
The only downside is that it can be a bit hard to learn and that is why we are here.
