# Assignment 1

1. Create a new directory named `GitInsurance-App`.
2. Initialize a new Git repository within this directory.
3. Create a simple README.md with the title "GitInsurance App" and a brief description of the project and a `.gitignore` file to ensure unwanted files like `pycache` or `.env` aren't tracked by Git.
4. Create a Python script named policy.py and add basic functions like `add_policy()`, `remove_policy()`, and `list_policies()`. Add and commit each function separately. Describe the functions in the markdown text.
