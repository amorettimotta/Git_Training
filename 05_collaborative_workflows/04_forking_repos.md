# Forking Repositories: Your Personal Copy on Git üç¥

No, there is not an emoji for a single fork, so we will have to live with a collateral knife.

Forking in Git allows you to make a personal copy of someone else's project. This enables you to work on a project without affecting the original repository, often serving as the first step in contributing to open-source projects. In this section, we delve into the ins and outs of forking repositories, how to maintain your fork, and ultimately how to contribute back to the source project.

## The Concept of Forking: Why and When? ü§î

Forking creates a snapshot of a repository at a specific point in time, but unlike a branch, this copy is entirely yours. It‚Äôs useful when you want to:

- Experiment with changes without affecting the original project.
- Start your project based on someone else's work.
- Contribute to a project by submitting pull requests.

## How to Fork a Repository?

1. Navigate to the GitHub page of the repository you wish to fork.
2. Click the "Fork" button on the top right and select where to create the fork if you belong to multiple organizations.

## Keeping Your Fork Updated: Syncing with the Source üîÑ

Staying up-to-date with the original repository is crucial. You can keep your fork synchronized by:

- Adding the original repository as an upstream remote.
- Fetching the latest changes from the original repo.
- Merging the updates into your fork.
- Pushing the changes to your fork on GitHub.

I know this might sound confusing, and that is why I will let Gwen tell you about the whole procedure.

## Contributing Back: Pull Requests from Forks ü§≤

Once you‚Äôve made your improvements or added new features to your fork, you can contribute back to the original repository through a pull request.
Steps to Submit a Pull Request from a Fork:

- Push your changes to your fork on GitHub.
- Navigate to the original repository you forked from.
- Click on the "New pull request" button.
- Choose your fork and the branch with your changes as the "compare" branch.
- Review the changes, add a description explaining your work, and create the pull request.
