# Basic Git Operations

The first thing we need to learn about Git is that it is not automatic... and this is good! Imagine having a save at _every change_ in your files... what a nightmare! 

Instead, you decide what files you want to record, when to take snapshots and you even decide what message to write as a caption of your snapshot.

Therefore, in this section, we will teach you:

1. How to [add/remove files](01_adding_files.md) to/from your snapshot batch.
2. How to [take snapshots](02_committing_changes.md).
3. [Viewing the history](03_viewing_logs.md) of snapshots.
4. [Best practises](04_writing_good_commit_messages.md) for when to take snapshots and how to write good messages.
